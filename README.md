## Projects

### Karokids e-commerce

- At karokids.co, an e-commerce platform built from scratch utilizing React and NodeJS.
  with a team of 8 developers through the project lifecycle, from inception to deployment and maintenance.
  Implemented a robust payment gateway powered by Stripe for seamless transaction processing.
- Successfully integrated authentication and authorization systems to ensure secure access to platform features.
  Contributed to the growth and scalability of karokids.co, laying the foundation for future enhancements and expansions.
  
- CI/CD using Vercel for Front-End Deployment and Railways for Back-End Deployment with Integrated Database:
  By leveraging Jest, we thoroughly test our codebase, including both front-end and back-end components, to identify and address any potential issues or bugs     
  before deployment.

- We leverage Vercel for continuous deployment of our front-end, enabling seamless deployment of any code changes and ensuring that new developments are swiftly   
  available to our users.

- For our back-end and database management, we utilize Railways as our deployment platform. With Railways, we manage both infrastructure and databases, 
  facilitating easy deployment and scaling of our applications without hassle.
  Our CI/CD workflow ensures continuous integration of front-end and back-end updates, enabling us to keep our application evolving and promptly respond to user 
  needs and market demands.
  
### Tech-Stack: 
    Frontend: React, Redux. Backend: NodeJS, Express. Database: PostgreSQL, Sequelize. Payment Processing: React- Stripe. CI/CD: Jest, Vercel, Railways, Github.


### CEC - Human Resource Managment
- Implemented a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure secure access to sensitive HR data.
- Collaborated closely with cross-functional teams to align technical solutions with HR business objectives and user requirements.
- Spearheaded the creation of a comprehensive platform capable of handling employee data management, performance evaluation, and recruitment processes.
- Empowers employers to efficiently manage payroll by facilitating salary transfers to employees. Additionally, the system allows for the recording of employee 
  advances, anticipations, installment payments, etc.
- At the end of each month, the system automatically generates detailed payroll statements for each employee as well as for the entire workforce, streamlining 
  payroll processing and ensuring accurate record-keeping.

- CI/CD and Deployment Strategy:
  * Leveraged Vercel for continuous deployment of our React front-end, ensuring rapid availability of updates to our users.
  * Utilized Railways as our deployment platform for managing the back-end infrastructure and database. This facilitated seamless deployment and scaling of HRMHub 
    without operational hassle.
  * Implemented a CI/CD workflow to ensure continuous integration of front-end and back-end updates, enabling agile development and rapid responses to HR industry demands.

    coverage.


### Web App: Integral Medical System
- I participated in the implementation of the WebApp - Medical ERP System. 
- I take pride in developing an integration module that revolutionized the process of notifying medical shifts for patients' appointments. By implementing this 
  solution, we achieved a remarkable 80% reduction in compliance times for scheduled shifts, leading to improved patient care and significantly reduced wait 
  times in the queues generated by patients following the order of arrival. 

### Tech Stack: 
    JavaScript, PHP LAMP, SQL Server/SQLite, Visual .NET, MySQL, MySQL Workbench.

## Experience

- Full Stack Labs Inc. - Senior Software Engenieer - Feb 2023 - Nov 2023 Â· 10 mos
  One of my significant accomplishments was improving the Toggl API report by seamlessly integrating it with Google Apps Script. This enhancement streamlined the 
  process of importing data directly into Google Sheets, eliminating the need for manual copying and pasting. With a simple click, users can now generate 
  accurate reports with minimal effort. In addition to my technical expertise, I am actively involved in the technical vetting process.
